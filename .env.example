# - Local dev: file:.mastra/db.sqlite
# - Production: file:.mastra/prod.sqlite
# 
# You can override with a custom path:
# MASTRA_DB_FILE=file:.mastra/custom.sqlite
#
# Note: The .mastra directory is gitignored and will be created automatically

# Observability (optional - for Vercel deployment)
# Vercel automatically configures OTEL when @vercel/otel is installed
# No additional env vars needed for basic tracing
