# Getting Started with Mastra

Mastra is a powerful framework for building AI agents. In this experiment, I explored its core features and capabilities.

## Overview

This experiment covers:
- Setting up Mastra in a Next.js application
- Creating custom agents
- Integrating with external APIs
- Best practices for production deployments

<Callout type="info" title="Prerequisites">
You should have basic knowledge of TypeScript and Next.js before diving into this experiment.
</Callout>

## Installation

First, install the required dependencies:

```bash
pnpm add @mastra/core
```

## Creating Your First Agent

Here's a simple example of creating an agent:

```typescript
import { Agent } from '@mastra/core';

const myAgent = new Agent({
  name: 'assistant',
  instructions: 'You are a helpful assistant.',
  model: {
    provider: 'openai',
    name: 'gpt-4',
  },
});
```

## Key Learnings

Through this experiment, I learned:

1. **Architecture Design**: Mastra provides a clean separation between agent logic and application code
2. **Flexibility**: Easy to integrate with various LLM providers
3. **Production Ready**: Built-in features for logging, error handling, and monitoring

<Callout type="success">
Mastra simplified my agent development workflow significantly, reducing boilerplate code by ~60%.
</Callout>

## Next Steps

- Explore advanced agent patterns
- Implement custom tools
- Set up production monitoring
