# Code Review Best Practices

Over the years, I've learned that effective code reviews are crucial for maintaining code quality and fostering team collaboration.

## The Importance of Code Reviews

Code reviews serve multiple purposes:
- Catch bugs before they reach production
- Share knowledge across the team
- Maintain consistent coding standards
- Improve overall code quality

The best code reviews focus on both the technical implementation and the problem-solving approach.

## Core Principles

### 1. Review with Empathy

Always remember there's a human on the other side. Frame feedback constructively:

```diff
- "This code is terrible"
+ "Consider using a Set here for O(1) lookup performance"
```

### 2. Focus on the Important Things

Prioritize your review comments:
- **Critical**: Security issues, bugs, performance problems
- **Important**: Design patterns, maintainability concerns
- **Nice to have**: Code style, naming conventions (use linters for this!)

### 3. Ask Questions

Instead of making demands, ask questions to understand the reasoning:

<Callout type="warning">
"Why did you choose this approach?" is more collaborative than "Change this to X."
</Callout>

## Practical Guidelines

Here are concrete practices I follow:

1. **Review within 24 hours**: Timely reviews keep the team moving
2. **Keep PRs small**: Aim for under 400 lines of code
3. **Use a checklist**: Ensure consistency across reviews
4. **Test the changes**: Don't just read code, run it

## Example Review Checklist

- [ ] Does the code solve the stated problem?
- [ ] Are there any potential security vulnerabilities?
- [ ] Is the code well-tested?
- [ ] Is the code maintainable and readable?
- [ ] Are edge cases handled?
- [ ] Is documentation updated?

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

<Callout type="error" title="Warning">
Don't use code reviews as a gatekeeping mechanism. They should be collaborative, not adversarial.
</Callout>

### Nitpicking

Avoid excessive comments on minor style issues. Use automated tools like ESLint and Prettier instead.

### Approval Fatigue

If a PR has been through multiple rounds and all major issues are addressed, approve it. Perfection is the enemy of progress.

## Conclusion

Effective code reviews are a skill that improves with practice. Focus on building a culture of constructive feedback and continuous improvement.
