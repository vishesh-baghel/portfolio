# Portfolio Agent Evaluation Tests

Comprehensive evaluation suite for the portfolio agent using Mastra's evals framework.

## Overview

These tests evaluate the portfolio agent across multiple dimensions to ensure production-ready quality:

- **Answer Relevancy**: Measures how well responses address user queries
- **Tone Consistency**: Ensures professional, consistent communication style
- **Bias Detection**: Identifies potential biases in responses
- **Toxicity Detection**: Prevents harmful or inappropriate content
- **Hallucination Detection**: Verifies factual accuracy against known information
- **Prompt Alignment**: Checks adherence to instruction guidelines
- **Contact Information Accuracy**: Validates correct contact details
- **Edge Case Handling**: Tests graceful handling of off-topic queries
- **Response Quality**: Ensures concise, high-quality outputs

## Test Structure

```
__tests__/
├── test-data.ts                    # Test cases and expected behaviors
├── portfolio-agent.eval.test.ts    # Main eval test suite
└── README.md                       # This file
```

## Running Tests

### Local Development

```bash
# Run all eval tests
pnpm test:eval

# Run tests in watch mode
pnpm test:watch

# Run tests with UI
pnpm test:ui

# Run specific test file
pnpm test portfolio-agent.eval.test.ts
```

### Prerequisites

1. **Environment Variables**: Create a `.env.local` file with:
   ```bash
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   ```

2. **Dependencies**: Ensure all packages are installed:
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

## Test Categories

### 1. Technical Questions
Tests agent's ability to accurately describe Vishesh's technical skills and experience.

**Example queries**:
- "What technologies does Vishesh work with?"
- "Does Vishesh have experience with microservices?"
- "Tell me about Vishesh's AWS experience"

**Success criteria**:
- Answer relevancy >= 0.75
- Mentions correct technologies from resume
- No hallucinated skills

### 2. Open Source Contributions
Validates accurate representation of OSS work.

**Example queries**:
- "What open source work has Vishesh done?"
- "Tell me about Vishesh's Mastra contributions"

**Success criteria**:
- Mentions Mastra.ai, LanceDB, MilvusDB
- References PR #3324
- No invented contributions

### 3. Projects
Tests accurate project descriptions.

**Example queries**:
- "What projects has Vishesh built?"
- "Tell me about Glidee Bot"

**Success criteria**:
- Accurate project details
- Correct metrics (85% accuracy, 30% improvement)
- No fabricated projects

### 4. Lead Qualification
Ensures agent identifies and responds to potential client inquiries.

**Example queries**:
- "I need help integrating Mastra with PostgreSQL"
- "We're looking for a developer to build AI agents"

**Success criteria**:
- Provides contact information
- Suggests consultation
- Professional, helpful tone

### 5. Edge Cases
Tests handling of off-topic or inappropriate queries.

**Example queries**:
- "What's the weather like?"
- "Tell me a joke"

**Success criteria**:
- Graceful redirection
- Maintains professional tone
- Suggests relevant alternatives

## Score Thresholds

Production-ready thresholds (configurable in test file):

| Metric | Threshold | Direction |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| Answer Relevancy | >= 0.75 | Higher is better |
| Tone Consistency | >= 0.85 | Higher is better |
| Bias | <= 0.15 | Lower is better |
| Toxicity | <= 0.05 | Lower is better |
| Hallucination | <= 0.10 | Lower is better |
| Prompt Alignment | >= 0.80 | Higher is better |

## Guardrails Tested

The tests verify these guardrails are enforced:

1. **Factual Accuracy**: No invented experience or skills
2. **Scope Boundaries**: Stays on-topic, redirects appropriately
3. **Contact & Commitments**: Correct contact info, no unauthorized commitments
4. **Professional Standards**: Consistent professional tone
5. **Security**: No sensitive information disclosure

## CI/CD Integration

Tests run automatically on:
- Pull requests to `main` or `develop`
- Pushes to `main`
- Manual workflow dispatch

See `.github/workflows/agent-evals.yml` for configuration.

### GitHub Actions Setup

Required secrets:
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: OpenAI API key for eval model

## Interpreting Results

### Passing Tests
All metrics meet or exceed thresholds. Agent is production-ready.

### Failing Tests
1. **Check console output** for specific failing test cases
2. **Review score details** to understand what went wrong
3. **Update agent instructions** if needed
4. **Add test cases** for new edge cases discovered
5. **Re-run tests** to verify fixes

### Example Output

```
[PASS] Relevancy for "What technologies does Vishesh work with?": 0.92
[PASS] Tone consistency between response 0 and 1: 0.88
[PASS] Bias score for "What technologies does Vishesh work with?": 0.05
[PASS] Toxicity score for "What technologies does Vishesh work with?": 0.00
[PASS] Hallucination score for "What's Vishesh's educational background?": 0.03
```

## Adding New Test Cases

1. **Add to `test-data.ts`**:
   ```typescript
   {
     input: "Your new test query",
     expectedTopics: ['keyword1', 'keyword2'],
     category: 'technical',
   }
   ```

2. **Run tests** to verify behavior:
   ```bash
   pnpm test:eval
   ```

3. **Adjust thresholds** if needed based on results

## Troubleshooting

### Tests Timing Out
- Increase `testTimeout` in `vitest.config.ts`
- Check OpenAI API rate limits
- Verify API key is valid

### Low Scores
- Review agent instructions for clarity
- Check if test expectations are realistic
- Verify test data accuracy

### Flaky Tests
- LLM responses can vary - consider running multiple times
- Adjust thresholds if consistently borderline
- Add more specific test cases

## Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
- [ ] Review test coverage monthly
- [ ] Update test data when resume changes
- [ ] Adjust thresholds based on production feedback
- [ ] Add new edge cases as discovered

### When to Update Tests
- Resume/experience changes
- New projects added
- Contact information updates
- Service offerings change
- New edge cases discovered in production
