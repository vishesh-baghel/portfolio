# Building with Next.js 15

Exploring the latest features and improvements in Next.js 15, including the new turbopack compiler and enhanced app router capabilities.

## What's New in Next.js 15?

Next.js 15 introduces several groundbreaking features:

- **Turbopack**: Lightning-fast bundler (now stable!)
- **Enhanced React 19 support**: Server actions and improved streaming
- **Partial Prerendering**: Combine static and dynamic content seamlessly
- **Improved caching**: Better control over data fetching

<Callout type="info" title="Performance Gains">
Turbopack showed 76.7% faster cold starts compared to Webpack in our tests.
</Callout>

## Setting Up a Project

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app
cd my-app
pnpm dev
```

## App Router Deep Dive

The app router continues to evolve with better patterns:

```typescript
// app/posts/[id]/page.tsx
export default async function PostPage({ 
  params 
}: { 
  params: Promise<{ id: string }> 
}) {
  const { id } = await params;
  const post = await getPost(id);
  
  return <article>{post.content}</article>;
}
```

## Server Actions

Server actions simplify form handling:

```typescript
async function createPost(formData: FormData) {
  'use server';
  
  const title = formData.get('title');
  await db.posts.create({ title });
  revalidatePath('/posts');
}
```

<Callout type="success">
Server actions eliminated ~200 lines of API route boilerplate in our production app.
</Callout>

## Key Learnings

1. **Migration Path**: Incremental adoption from Pages to App router is smooth
2. **Type Safety**: Better TypeScript integration with async params
3. **Performance**: Real-world improvements align with benchmarks
4. **Developer Experience**: Hot reload is noticeably faster

## Trade-offs

<Callout type="warning">
Be cautious with client-side state management when mixing server and client components.
</Callout>
